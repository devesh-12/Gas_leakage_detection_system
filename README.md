# Gas_leakage_detection_system
It is a system made up with arduino uno microcontroller and interfaced with MQ2 gas sensor and GSM module along with displaying data on the LCD.
In this project we will use gas sensor and gsm module to create a gas detection 
System that will prevent major accidents and lives that are lost due to accident
The MQ5 gas sensor will sense the gas and send the signal to Arduino and the 
Output will be displayed on the 16 X 2 lcd that is connected to Arduino uno r3
And the gsm module will send the SMS to the respective mobile number and the 
Person will be aware of the accident.
This project has an effective cost of 2000/- and it is effective on many appliances.
We can add flame sensor and other many modules to make it on a large scale and 
Use it more effectively.
The disadvantage of this project is that it works on a limited range, but hence that 
Problem can be solved using by connecting other modules.
Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of ‘things’ by which 
physical things can communicate with the help of sensors, 
electronics, software, and connectivity
